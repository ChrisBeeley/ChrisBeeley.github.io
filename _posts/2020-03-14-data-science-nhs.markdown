I've found that a lot of people are confused about open source and IP when NHS employees are open sourcing code, and so I've started writing stuff about it.

It's grown and grown into something that looks more generally at data science in the NHS, and the framework I'm working on at the moment is the [NHS digital service standards](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/service-standard). I suspect the focus will grow over time.

It's just me trying to write everything down and have an easy way to show it to people. I'm making mistakes and learning as I go, so please jump in anywhere and tell me where I'm wrong (or right!) or write a whole chapter or whatever you like really.

It's very early work, full of holes, misunderstandings, and worse I'm sure. [Find the document here](https://chrisbeeley.github.io/data-science-nhs/).
