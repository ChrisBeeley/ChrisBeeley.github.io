This is my new website, or rather it will be. I've got a blog and website over at [http://chrisbeeley.net], the website bit of which I made by hand with HTML and CSS and it is therefore absolutely hideous (the blog is fine, it's WordPress). The reason why I'm doing this is because I've got a bookdown project to publish and so I thought now was a good time to learn about all these newfangled static site generators. I suspect my team will have a GitHub page in less than a year and individual team members might wish to make their own, so I'm finding out about it on their behalf.

This is NOT supposed to be a blog, and I know that you can make Jekyll sites that don't look like blogs, but I'm totally new at this so haven't figured it out yet. I really need to start getting stuff out there so I don't have time to wait for perfection (or even adequacy).
